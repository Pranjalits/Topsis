# Topsis
The TOPSIS method. TOPSIS is based on the fundamental premise that the best solution has the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution, and the longest distance from the negative-ideal one. Alternatives are ranked with the use of an overall index calculated based on the distances from the idealÂ solutions.
